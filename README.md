## Pokemon Database Example

This is a Python example that demonstrates how to work with a PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library, create a database, and perform various operations on it.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- PostgreSQL server installed and running.
- Python 3.x installed.
- The `psycopg2` library installed (`pip install psycopg2`).

## Tasks

### 1. Database Setup

- Create a new Python virtual environment (recommended).
- Install the required libraries using `pip install psycopg2`.
- Set up your PostgreSQL connection parameters (`your_database_name`, `your_user`, `your_password`, `localhost`) in the Python script.

### 2. Run the Python Script

- Run the Python script (`pokemon_database.py`) to create the database, Pokemon table, and perform CRUD operations.

### 3. Create a CSV File

- Run the Python script (`generate_pokemon_csv.py`) to generate a CSV file with 50 Pokemon entries.

### 4. Display All Pokemon

- Update the Python script to add a function that displays all Pokemon entries from the database.

### 5. Connection Pooling (Optional)

- Explore the option of using connection pooling to manage database connections more efficiently.

### 6. Handling Database Exists

- Modify the Python script to check if the database already exists before creating it.

### 7. Documentation

- Update the README file with any additional information or modifications to the example.

## Additional Notes

- You can adjust the Pokemon names, data generation logic, and other attributes as needed.
- Make sure to replace placeholders like `your_database_name`, `your_user`, and `your_password` with your actual database credentials.
